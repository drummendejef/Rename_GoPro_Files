# Rename_GoPro_Files
I want to order the files a GoPro makes by renaming them.

We use a GoPro for filming longer sessions. The GoPro splits video files in 2GB each. The names are confusing and I wanted to make the order of the files clear.

This program orders the files from the time they were created and places "Part_number" in front of them.

Easy as that.

(First try at an .net core application)

#Installer
Use the installer if you don't have something like Visual Studio installed.

#Code
In the "Rename_GoPro_Files" folder there are 2 folders. 
.NET Core and .NET Framework. Both do the same, just a test of me.
